#Spine

__Spine is a lightweight framework for building JavaScript web applications.__ Spine gives you a MVC structure and then gets out of your way,  allowing you to concentrate on the fun stuff, building awesome web applications. 

Spine is opinionated and, although at first glance it might look similar to other frameworks like Backbone, it actually has quite a different take on things. 

Spine is tiny, the library comes in at around 500 lines of JavaScript, that's about 2K minified & compressed. However, it's not about size, it's how you use it, and Spine certainly packs a punch! 

__Latest version:__ [0.0.4](spine.js) ([minified](spine.min.js)).
Or check out the [source code](http://github.com/maccman/spine).

#Overview

So, what's so special about Spine, how does it stand out from the crowd?

* Class library with __real__ prototypal inheritance
* Lightweight __controller__ implementation, based on Backbone's API
* Full __model__ layer and ORM
* Ajax and HTML5 Local Storage adapters baked in
* Asynchronous server communication
* Works in __all major browsers__ (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE >= 7)
* Simple and lightweight
* Thorough documentation

But don't take my word for it. Take a look at the source of the example applications below, and decide for yourself. 

#Tutorials

Spine has a growing __[set of tutorials](http://maccman.github.com/spine.tutorials/)__, from layouts, tabs and sidebars to forms, updating records and validation.

#Examples

Spine includes some great example applications to show you what's possible with the framework, and give you a practical understanding of the library. Although Spine is cross browser, it's worth noting that some of the examples are for WebKit based browsers only (Chrome/Safari), due to browser specific CSS (i.e. they'll just look really ugly in other browsers). 

Todos is a very simple to-do application. Users can CRUD tasks, and mark them as complete.
The source is [available on GitHub](http://github.com/maccman/spine.todos). [[Demo]](http://maccman.github.com/spine.todos)

#Setup

Using Spine is very straightforward, simply include the library in the page.

    <script src="spine.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
    
Spine has no prerequisites, but is optimized to work with [jQuery](http://jquery.com) or [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com).
Certain extensions to Spine, such as the Ajax and Local Storage model persistence, require additional files located inside the [lib](https://github.com/maccman/spine/tree/master/lib) folder.
    
#Classes

Spine's class implementation is one of its features that makes it stand out from the crowd. Rather than copying properties to emulate inheritance, as most libraries, Spine uses JavaScript's native prototypal inheritance. This is how inheritance should be done, and means it's dynamic, properties are resolved at runtime.

Classes are created like so:

    var Task = Spine.Class.create();

`create()` takes optional arguments of instance properties, and class properties.

    Spine.Class.create([instanceProperties, classProperties]);

    var User = Spine.Class.create({
      name: "Carolin"
    });
    
Alternatively you can add instance properties using `include()`, and class properties with `extend()`.

    var User = Spine.Class.create();
    
    User.extend({
      find: function(){ /* ... */ }
    });
    
    User.include({
      name: "Tonje"
    });

Since Spine doesn't use constructor functions, due to limitations with prototypal inheritance, classes are instantiated with `init()`.

    var User = Spine.Class.create({
      name: "Tonje"
    });
    
    var user = User.init();
    
    assertEqual( user.name, "Tonje" );
    user.name = "Trish";
    assertEqual( user.name, "Trish" );

Any arguments passed to `init()` will be forwarded to `init()`, the classes' instantiation callback.

    var User = Spine.Class.create({
      init: function(name){
        this.name = name;
      }
    });

    User.init("Martina");
    assertEqual( user.name, "Martina" );

Sub-classes are created the same way base classes are, with `create()`.

    var Friend = User.create();
    
All of the subclass's parent properties are inherited.

    var friend = Friend.init("Tim");
    
    assertEqual( friend.name, "Tim" );
    
Because we're using real prototypal inheritance, properties are resolved dynamically at runtime. This means that you can change the properties of a parent class, and all its sub-classes with reflect those changes immediately. 

    var User   = Spine.Class.create();
    var Friend = User.create();
    
    User.include({defaultName: "(empty)"});

    assertEqual( Friend.init().defaultName, "(empty)" );

##Context

Context changes constantly in JavaScript, and it's very important your code is executing in the correct one. The most common cause of this is with event listeners, where callbacks will be invoked in the context of `window` or the element, rather than their original context. To resolve this, Spine's classes provides a few helper functions for maintaing context.

You can pass a function to `proxy()` to guarantee that it will be invoked in the current context.

    var Tasks = Spine.Class.create({
      init: function(){
        $("#destroy").click(this.proxy(this.destroy));
      },
      
      destroy: function(){ /* ... */ }
    });

Or pass multiple function names to `proxyAll()` in order to re-write them permanently, so they're always called with the classes' local content. 

    var Tasks = Spine.Class.create({
      init: function(){
        this.proxyAll("destroy")
        $("#destroy").click(this.destroy);
      },
      
      destroy: function(){ /* ... */ }
    });

#Events

`Spine.Events` is the module Spine uses for adding event support to classes. To use it, just include/extend a class with the module. 

    class Tasks extends Spine.Module
      @extend(Spine.Events)
    
`Spine.Events` gives you three functions, `bind()`, `trigger()`, and `unbind()`. All three have a very similar API to jQuery's event handling one, if you're familiar with that. `bind(name, callback)` takes a event name and callback. `trigger(name, [*data])` takes an event name and optional data to be passed to handlers. `unbind(name, [callback])` takes a event name and optional callback.
    
    Tasks.bind "create", (foo, bar) -> 
    Tasks.trigger "create", "some", "data"

You can bind to multiple events by separating them with spaces. Callbacks are invoked in the context the event is associated with. 

    Tasks.bind("create update destroy", -> @trigger("change"))
    
You can pass optional data arguments to `trigger()` that will be passed onto event callbacks. Unlike jQuery, an event object will not be passed to callbacks.

    Tasks.bind "create", (name) -> alert(name)
    Tasks.trigger "create", "Take out the rubbish"
    
Although you might never use `Spine.Events` in your own classes, you will use it with Spine's models and controllers. We're going to cover those next.
    
#Models

Models are the core to Spine, and absolutely critical to your applications. Models are where your application's data is stored, and where any logic associated with that data is kept. Models should be de-coupled from the rest of your application, and completely independent. The data associated with models is stored in memory under `Model.records`.

Creating models is slightly different from creating classes, since the `create()` function is already reserved by models. Models are created with the `setup()` function, passing in the model name and an array of attributes.

    class Contact extends Spine.Model
      @configure "Contact", "first_name", "last_name"

Models are Spine classes, so you can treat them as such, extending and including properties.

    class Contact extends Spine.Model
      @configure "Contact", "first_name", "last_name"
      
      fullName: -> @first_name + " " + @last_name
    
Model instances are created with `init()`, passing in an optional set of attributes.

    contact = new Contact(first_name: "Alex", last_name: "MacCaw")
    assertEqual( contact.fullName(), "Alex MacCaw" )
    
Models can be also be easily subclassed:

    class User extends Contact
      @configure "User"
    
##Saving/Retrieving Records

Once an instance is created it can be saved in memory by calling `save()`.

    class Contact extends Spine.Model
      @configure "Contact", "first_name", "last_name"
      
    contact = new Contact(first_name: "Joe")
    contact.save()
    
When a record is saved, Spine automatically creates an ID if it doesn't already exist.

    assertEqual( contact.id, "AD9408B3-1229-4150-A6CC-B507DFDF8E90" )
    
You can use this ID to retrieve the saved record using `find()`.

    identicalContact = Contact.find( contact.id )
    assert( contact.eql( identicalContact ) )
    
If `find()` fails to retrieve a record, an exception will be thrown. You can check for the existence of records without fear of an exception by calling `exists()`.

    assert( Contact.exists( contact.id ) )
    
Once you've changed any of a record's attributes, you can update it in-memory by re-calling `save()`.

    contact = Contact.create({first_name: "Polo"})
    contact.save()
    contact.first_name = "Marko"
    contact.save()
    
You can also use `first()` or `last()` on the model to retrieve the first and last records respectively.

    firstContact = Contact.first()
    
To retrieve every contact, use `all()`.

    contacts = Contact.all()
    console.log(contact.name) for contact in contacts

You can pass a function that'll be iterated over every record using `each()`.

    Contact.each (contact) -> console.log(console.first_name)
    
Or select a subset of records with `select()`.

    Contact.select (contact) -> contact.first_name
    
##Validation

Validating models is dirt simple, simply override the `validate()` function with your own custom one.

    class Contact extends Spine.Model
      validate: ->
        unless @first_name
          "First name is required"

If `validate()` returns anything, the validation will fail and an *error* event will be fired on the model. You can catch this by listening for it on the model, notifying the user.
    
    Contact.bind "error", (rec, msg) ->
      alert("Contact failed to save - " + msg)
    
In addition, `save()`, `create()` and `updateAttributes()` will all return false if validation fails. For more information about validation, see the [form tutorial](http://maccman.github.com/spine.tutorials/form.html).

##Serialization

Spine's models include special support for JSON serialization. To serialize a record, call `JSON.stringify()` passing the record, or to serialize every record, pass the model.

    JSON.stringify(Contact)
    JSON.stringify(Contact.first())
    
Alternatively, you can retrieve an instance's attributes and implement your own serialization by calling `attributes()`.

    contact = new Contact(first_name: "Leo")
    assertEqual( contact.attributes(), {first_name: "Leo"} )
    
    Contact.include
      toXML: ->
        serializeToXML(@attributes())
    
If you're using an older browser which doesn't have native JSON support (i.e. IE 7), you'll need to include [json2.js](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js) which adds legacy support. 

##Persistence

While storing records in memory is useful for quick retrieval, persisting them in one way or another is often required. Spine includes a number of pre-existing storage modules, such as Ajax and HTML5 Local Storage, which you can use for persistence. Alternatively you can roll your own custom one, take a look at `spine.ajax.js` for inspiration. 

Spine's persistence is implemented via modules, so for HTML5 Local Storage persistence you'll need to include [spine.local.js](lib/spine.local.js) script in the page and for Ajax persistence you'll need [spine.ajax.js](lib/spine.ajax.js).

To persist a model using HTML5 Local Storage, simply extend it with `Spine.Model.Local`.

    class Contact extends Spine.Model
      @extend Spine.Model.Local

When a record is changed, the Local Storage database will be updated to reflect that. In order to fetch the records from Local Storage in the first place, you need to use `fetch()`. 

    Contact.fetch()
    
Typically this is called once, when your application is first initialized. 

###Using Ajax

Using Ajax as a persistence mechanism is very similar, extend models with `Spine.Model.Ajax`.

    class Contact extends Spine.Model
      @extend Spine.Model.Ajax
    
By convention, this uses a basic pluralization mechanism to generate an endpoint, in this case `/contacts`. You can choose a custom URL by setting the `url` property on your model, like so:

    class Contact extends Spine.Model
      @extend Spine.Model.Ajax
  
      url: "/users"
    
Spine will use this endpoint URL as a basis for all of its Ajax requests. Once a model has been persisted with Ajax, whenever its records are changed, Spine will send an Ajax request notifying the server. Spine encodes all of its request's parameters with JSON, and expects JSON encoded responses. Spine uses REST to determine the method and endpoint of HTTP requests, and will work seamlessly with REST friendly frameworks like Rails.

    read    → GET    /collection
    create  → POST   /collection
    update  → PUT    /collection/id
    destroy → DELETE /collection/id

For example, after a record has been created client side Spine will send off an HTTP POST to your server, including a JSON representation of the record. Let's say we created a `Contact` with a name of `"Lars"`, this is the request that would be send to the server:

    POST /contacts HTTP/1.0
    Host: localhost:3000
    Origin: http://localhost:3000
    Content-Length: 59
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {"id":"E537616F-F5C3-4C2B-8537-7661C7AC101E","name":"Lars"}

Likewise destroying a record will trigger a DELETE request to the server, and updating a record will trigger a PUT request. For PUT and DELETE requests, the records ID is referenced inside the URL.

    PUT /tasks/E537616F-F5C3-4C2B-8537-7661C7AC101E HTTP/1.0
    Host: localhost:3000
    Origin: http://localhost:3000
    Content-Length: 60
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {"id":"44E1DB33-2455-4728-AEA2-ECBD724B5E7B","name":"Peter"}

As you can see, the record's attributes aren't prefixed by the record's model name. This can cause problems with frameworks like Rails, which expect parameters in a certain format. You can fix this, by setting the `ajaxPrefix` option.
    
    Spine.Model.ajaxPrefix = true;
    
If `ajaxPrefix` is true, Spine will send requests like the following, prefixing all the attributes with the model name. 

    PUT /tasks/E537616F-F5C3-4C2B-8537-7661C7AC101E HTTP/1.0
    Host: localhost:3000
    Origin: http://localhost:3000
    Content-Length: 73
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {"contact": {"id":"44E1DB33-2455-4728-AEA2-ECBD724B5E7B","name":"Peter"}}
    
It's worth mentioning here one of the major differences between Spine and other similar frameworks. All of Spine's server communication is asynchronous - that is Spine never waits for a response. Requests are sent after the operation has completed successfully client side. In other words, a POST request will be sent to the server after the record has successfully saved client side, and the UI has updated. The server is completely de-coupled from the client, clients don't necessarily need a server in order to function.

This might seem like an odd architectural decision at first, but let me explain. Having a de-coupled server offers some clear advantages. Firstly, clients have a completely non-blocking interface, they're never waiting for a slow server response for further interaction with your application. User's don't have to know, or care, about server requests being fired off in the background - they can continue using the application without any loading spinners.

The second advantage is that a de-coupled server greatly simplifies your code. You don't need to cater for the scenario that the record may be displayed in your interface, but isn't editable until a server response returns. Lastly, if you ever decided to add offline support to your application, having a de-coupled server makes this a doddle. 

Obviously there are caveats for those advantages, but I think those are easily addressed. Server-side model validation is a contentious issue, for example - what if that fails? However, this is solved by client-side validation. Validation should fail before a record ever gets sent to the server. If validation does fail server-side, it's an error in your client-side validation logic rather than with user input. 

When the server does return an unsuccessful response, an *ajaxError* event will be fired on the model, including the record, XMLHttpRequest object, Ajax settings and the thrown error. 

    Contact.bind "ajaxError", (record, xhr, settings, error) -> /* Invalid response... */ 

##Events

You've already seen that models have some events associated with them, such as *error* and *ajaxError*, but what about callbacks to create/update/destroy operations? Well, conveniently Spine includes those too, allowing you to bind to the following events:

* *save* - record was saved (either created/updated)
* *update* - record was updated
* *create* - record was created
* *destroy* - record was destroyed
* *change* - any of the above, record was created/updated/destroyed
* *refresh* - all records invalidated and replaced
* *error* - validation failed

For example, you can bind to a model's *create* event like so:

    Contact.bind "create", (newRecord) ->
      // New record was created
    
For model level callbacks, any associated record is always passed to the callback. The other option is to bind to the event directly on the record.

    contact = Contact.first()
    contact.bind "save", ->
      // Contact was updated
    
The callback's context will be the record that the event listener was placed on. You'll find model events crucial when it comes to binding records to the view, making sure the view is kept in sync with your application's data. 

##Dynamic records

One rather neat addition to Spine's models is dynamic records, which use prototypal inheritance to stay updated. Any calls to `find()`, `all()`, `first()`, `last()` etc, and model event callbacks return a *clone* of the saved record. This means that whenever a record is updated, all of its clones will immediately reflect that update.

Let's give you a code example; we're going to create an asset, and a clone of that asset. You'll notice that when the asset is updated, the clone has also automatically changed. 

    asset = Asset.create(name: "whatshisname")
    
    // Completely new asset instance
    clone = Asset.find(asset.id)

    // Change saved asset
    asset.updateAttributes(name: "bob")
    
    // Clone reflects changes
    assertEqual(clone.name, "bob")
    
This means that you never have to bother calling some sort of `reload()` functions on instances. You can be sure that all instances are constantly in sync with their saved versions. 

#Controllers

Controllers are the last part to the trinity of Spine and are very simple, being more of a set of conventions than actual code. Controllers are the glue inside your application, tying the various components together. Generally, controllers deal with adding and responding to DOM events, rendering templates and keeping views and models in sync.

Controllers, like models, extend `Spine.Class` and so inherit all of its properties. This means you can use `extend()` and `include()` to add properties onto controllers, and can take advantage of all of Spine's context management. To create a controller, inherit a class from `Spine.Controller`.

    class Tasks extends Spine.Controller
      constructor: ->
        super
        // Called on instantiation
    
The convention inside Spine is to give the controller a plural camel cased name of the model it is most associated with, in this case `Tasks`. Usually, you'll only be adding instance properties onto controllers, so you can just pass them as the first argument to `create()`. Instantiating controllers is the same as creating an instance of any other class, by calling `init()`.

    tasks = new Tasks
    
Every controller has an element associated with it, which you can access under the instance property `el`. This element is set automatically when creating a controller instance. The type of element created is specified by the `tag` property, which by default is `"div"`.

    class TaskItem extends Spine.Controller
      tag: "li"
      
    # taskItem.el is a <li></li> element
    taskItem = new TaskItem 

The `el` property can also be set manually by passing it through on instantiation.
    
    tasks = new Tasks(el: $("#tasks"));

In fact, anything you pass to `init()` will be set as properties on the newly created instance. For example, you could pass a record that a controller would be associated with.

    taskItem = new TaskItem(item: Task.first())

Inside your controller's `init()` function, you'll generally add event listeners to models and views, referencing a function inside the controller. 

##Events

Spine gives you a shortcut for adding event listeners onto DOM elements, with the `events` property. 

    class Tasks extends Spine.Controller
      events: 
        "click .item": "click"
      
      click: (event) ->
        // Invoked when .item is clicked
    
`events` is an object in the following format `{"eventType selector", "functionName"}`. All the selectors are scoped to the controller's associated element, `el`. If a selector isn't provided, the event will be added directly on `el`, otherwise it'll be delegated to any children matching the selector. 

Spine will take care of callback context for you, making sure it keeps to the current controller. Callbacks will be passed an event object, and you can access the original element the event was targeted on using `event.target`.

    class Tasks extends Spine.Controller
      events: 
        "click .item": "click"
  
      click: (event) ->
        item = jQuery(event.target);

Since Spine uses [delegation](http://api.jquery.com/delegate) for events, it doesn't matter if the contents of `el` change. The appropriate events will still be fired when necessary. 

As well as DOM events, `Spine.Controller` has been extended with `Spine.Events`, meaning that you can bind and trigger custom events. 

    class ToggleView extends Spine.Controller
      constructor: ->
        super
        @items = @$(".items")
        @items.click => @trigger("toggle")
        @bind "toggle", @toggle
        
      toggle: ->
        # ...

Spine also has a global object `Spine.App`, that you can bind and trigger global events. This is one way that you can get controllers communicating with one other, without resorting to deep-coupling. `Spine.App` is aliased inside controllers to `this.App`.

    class GlobalController extends Spine.Controller
      constructor: ->
        super
        @el.click @click
        
      click: =>        

##Elements

When you first instantiate a controller, it's common to set a bunch of instance variables referencing various elements. For example, setting the `items` variable on the `Tasks` controller:

    class Tasks extends Spine.Controller
      constructor: ->
        super
        @items = @$(".items")
    
Since this is such a common scenario, Spine provides a helper, the `elements` property. The is in the format of `{"selector": "variableName"}`. When the controller is instantiated, Spine will go through `elements`, setting the appropriate elements as properties on the instance. Like with `events`, all the selectors are scoped by the controller's current element, `el`.

    class Tasks extends Spine.Controller
      elements:
        ".items": "items"
      
      constructor: ->
        super
        @items.each -> #...
    
#Routing

Spine provides application routing based on the URL's hash fragment, for example the URL `http://example.com/#/users` has the hash fragment `/users`. Hash fragments can be completely arbitrary and don't trigger page reloads, maintaining page state. Your application can also be indexed by hash fragments using Google's [Ajax Crawling specification](http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/index.html).

Internally Spine uses the *hashchange* event to detect changes in the URLs hash. This event has only been developed recently, and only available in newer browsers. To support antiquated browsers, you can use the excellent [jQuery hashchange plugin](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/), which emulates the event using iframes and other clever trickery. 

##Adding routes

So, how to use the API? It's very simple, first you need to include [spine.route.js](lib/spine.route.js), which contains the module `Spine.Route`. Then you can start adding routes inside your controller. `Spine.Route` gives you a `routes()` function inside controllers, which you can call passing a hash of routes and callbacks.

    class App extends Spine.Controller
      constructor: ->
        @routes
          "/users/:id": (params) ->
            console.log("/users/", params.id)
          "/users": ->
            console.log("users")

Route parameters, are in the form of `:name`, and are passed as arguments to the associated callback. You can also use globs to match anything via an asterisk, like so: 

    @routes
      "/pages/*glob": (params) ->
        console.log("/pages/", params.glob)

Routes are added in reverse order of specificity, so the most specific routes should be added first, and generic 'catch alls' should be added later. It's worth noting, especially if you're putting routes in the `init()` function of controllers, that routes shouldn't be added more than once. The examples above are fine, since the `App` controller is only ever going to be instantiated a single time. 

One alternative is to skip out controllers, and add routes directly using `Spine.Route.add()`, passing in either a hash or a single route. 
    
    Spine.Route.add /\/groups(\/)?/, -> console.log("groups")
    
Like you can see in the example above, routes can also be raw regexes, giving you full control over matching.

##Initial Setup

When the page loads initially, even if the URL has a hash fragment, the `hashchange` event won't be called. It'll only be called for subsequent changes. This means, after our application has been setup, we need to manually tell Spine that we want to run the routes & check the URL's hash. This can be done by invoking `Spine.Route.setup()`.
    
    Spine.Route.setup()
    
##Navigate
    
Lastly, Spine gives controllers a `navigate()` function, which can be passed a fragment to change the URL's hash. You can also pass `navigate()` multiple arguments, which will be joined by a forward slash (`/`) to create the fragment. 

    var Users = Spine.Controller.create({
      init: function(){
        // Navigate to #/users/:id
        this.navigate("/users", this.item.id);
      }
    });
    
    Users.init({item: User.first()});
    
Using `navigate()` ensures that the URL's fragment is kept in sync with the relevant controllers. By default, calling `navigate()` __won't__ trigger any events or route callbacks. If you want to trigger routes, pass a `true` boolean as the last argument to `navigate()`.

    // Trigger routes by passing true
    Spine.Route.navigate("/users", true);

##HTML5 History

Spine also gives you the option of using HTML5's History API, which has the advantage of being able to alter the url without a page refresh or using hash fragments. This means cleaner URLs in a format your users are accustomed to. 

To use the History API, instead of hash fragments, pass `{history: true}` to `setup()`:

    Spine.Route.setup({history: true});
    
HTML5 History support will only be enabled if this option is present, and the API is available. Otherwise, Spine's routing will revert back to using hash fragments. 

However, there are some things you need to be aware of when using the History API. Firstly, ever URL you send to `navigate()` needs to have a real HTML representation. Although the browser won't request the new URL at that point, it will be requested if the page is subsequently reloaded. In other words you can't make up arbitrary URLs, like you can with hash fragments; every URL passed to the API needs to exist. One way of implementing this is with server side support. 

When browsers request a URL (expecting a HTML response) you first make sure on server-side that the endpoint exists and is valid. Then you can just serve up the main application, which will read the URL, invoking the appropriate routes. For example, let's say your user navigates to `http://example.com/users/1`. On the server-side, you check that the URL `/users/1` is valid, and that the User record with an ID of `1` exists. Then you can go ahead and just serve up the JavaScript application. 

The caveat to this approach is that it doesn't give search engine crawlers any real content. If you want your application to be crawl-able, you'll have to detect crawler bot requests, and serve them a 'parallel universe of content'. That is beyond the scope of this documentation though. 
    
    
#Patterns

We've covered all the main options available in controllers, so let's have a look at some typical use cases. 

##The Render Pattern

The *render pattern* is a really useful way of binding models and views together. When the controller is instantiated, it adds an event listener to the relevant model, invoking a callback when the model is refreshed or changed. The callback will update `el`, usually by replacing its contents with a rendered template. 

    var Contacts = Spine.Controller.create({
      init: function(){
        Contact.bind("refresh change", this.proxy(this.render));
      },

      template: function(items){ 
        return($("#contactsTemplate").tmpl(items));
      },

      render: function(){
        this.el.html(this.template(Contact.all()));
      }
    });
    
This is a simple but blunt method for data binding, updating every element whenever a single record is changed. This is fine for uncomplicated and small lists, but you may find you need more control over individual elements, such as adding event handlers to items. This is where the *element pattern* comes in.

##The Element pattern

The element pattern essentially gives you the same functionality as the render pattern, but a lot more control. It consists of two controllers, one that controls a collection of items, and the other deals with each individual item. Let's dive right into the code to give you a good indication of how it works.

    var ContactItem = Spine.Controller.create({
      // Delegate the click event to a local handler
      events: {
        "click": "click"
      },
      
      // Ensure functions have the correct context
      proxied: ["render", "remove"],
      
      // Bind events to the record
      init: function(){
        this.item.bind("update", this.render);
        this.item.bind("destroy", this.remove);
      },

      // Render an element
      render: function(item){
        if (item) this.item = item;

        this.el.html(this.template(this.item));
        return this;
      },

      // Use a template, in this case via jQuery.tmpl.js
      template: function(items){ 
        return($("#contactsTemplate").tmpl(items));
      },

      // Called after an element is destroyed
      remove: function(){
        this.el.remove();
      },
      
      // We have fine control over events, and 
      // easy access to the record too
      click: function(){ /* ... */ }
    });

    var Contacts = Spine.Controller.create({
      proxied: ["addAll", "addOne"],

      init: function(){
        Contact.bind("refresh", this.addAll);
        Contact.bind("create",  this.addOne);
      },

      addOne: function(item){
        var contact = ContactItem.init({item: item});
        this.el.append(contact.render().el);
      },

      addAll: function(){
        Contact.each(this.addOne);
      }
    });
    
In the example above, `Contacts` has responsibility for adding records when they're initially created, and `ContactItem` has responsibility for the record's update and destroy events, re-rendering the record when necessary. Albeit more complicated, this gives us some advantages over the previous render pattern. 

For one thing, it's more performant; the list doesn't need to be re-drawn whenever a single element changes. Furthermore, we now have a lot more control over individual items. We can place event handlers, as demonstrated with the `click` callback, and manage rendering on an item by item basis.

#FAQ

* *Whoah - your API looks really similar to Backbone. Why should I use this instead?*
  Well, it's true that Spine was inspired by Backbone, an excellent library, and its controller API is very similar. However, the similarities end there. Internally the library works very differently. For example, Spine has no need for `Collections`, which are required for pretty much every model in Backbone. Spine provides a class library, and has very different ideas when it comes to server sync. Lastly, Spine is much simpler and half the size, go and [check out the source](http://github.com/maccman/spine).
  
* *What's so good about prototypal inheritance?*
  Let me give you a visual example of what I mean. Take a Spine class instance, you can follow its `__proto__` property through its parents, all the way up to `Object`.
  ![Inheritance](site/images/inheritance.png)  
  Classical class libraries just copy properties to achieve inheritance, resulting in overhead when your class is first loaded, and doesn't allow for dynamically resolving properties. 
  
* *Doesn't the fact that servers are de-coupled, and clients never wait for a response, cause issues like conflicts?*
  Nope, certainly not in my experience. Ajax requests to the server are sent serially, requests have to finish before the next one is fired, even if the client UI has already updated. For example, if a contact is created and then immediately destroyed, the create POST will complete before the DELETE request is sent. Certainly, there may be scenarios where you need to disable a UI element while waiting for a server response, but this isn't usually required, and so isn't the default inside Spine. 
  
* *I still don't get the advantages of server de-coupling.*
  Well, it's all about perceived speed - which makes a huge difference to the user experience. Perceived speed is just as important as actual speed since, at the end of the day, this is what users are going to notice. If we take [Holla](http://github.com/maccman/holla) as an example, when a user sends a new chat message, we could wait until the message takes the roundtrip through the server and clients before appending it to the chat log. However, that would introduce a couple of seconds latency between the time a user submitted a new message, and it appearing in their chat log. The application would seem slow, and it would definitely hurt the user experience. 

  Instead, why not create the new message locally, thereby immediately adding it to the chat log. From a user's perspective, it seems like the message has been sent instantly. User's won't know (or care), that the message hasn't yet been delivered to other clients in the chat room. They'll just be happy with a fast and snappy user experience.
  
  That's why server de-coupling and perceived speed is important, __it gives a much better user experience__.
